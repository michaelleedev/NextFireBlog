# About
This project was a follow along guide from [fireship.io](https://fireship.io/courses/react-next-firebase/). This project uses Next.js as its framework to handle server side rendering and static page generations. Thanks to Next, when server side is not needed, we can render the website on the client. Firebase was used to handle almost everything from authentication to database and file storage. CSS styling and general format of the website was given by the guide. At the time of working on this project (August 2023), Firebase released its version 10.0, which resulted in me refactoring a lot of code from the guide so it would work with the new version. I couldn't use the version mentioned in the guide due to dependency issues with other librarys including Next. I opted to use Page routing instead of the new App routing in Next.js 13 because I couldn't find adequate resource to refactor from the guide. This projects is deployed on Vercel with Github CI. 

# Version 1.0
The basic functionality that was in the guide is implemented. This includes authentication, real  time home feed, post created and edit, image upload, post interaction through 'hearts', profile page, and posts page.
